# Sudoku-Solver-CPP
A simple C++ program that takes an unfinished Sudoku puzzle and finds a solution to the puzzle. Made one day while bored at the airport.

Program provides simple command line user interface, with options to input/output puzzles/solutions through both the console and through files. The command line interface also
provides a help menu, describing the format of the input and output the solver uses.

Currently, no arguments are accepted by the program to bypass te user interface. They may be added in the future, however.
